# Philosophy Blog Project

The site is titled The Prokopton Circle, a greek word meaning "one who is making progress along the Stoic path." 

It is a full-stack web application built using JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Node.js, ExpressJS, EJS, Bootstrap, and MongoDB. The goal of the project is to bring together a community of individuals with a shared passion for philosophy and provide a platform for them to share their thoughts and ideas.
